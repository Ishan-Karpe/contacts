### A simple contacts program in Python, one of my OG Projects

--------------------------

If you don't know who I am yet, my name is Ishan. I am a teenager who is a PCAP certififed programmer, who is now coding unique projects so that I can learn how to write code efficently in Python and make it understandable to ANYONE through my comments. 

--------------------------

####  I create my programs with lots of comments so that:
    1. I can understand what I did when I come back to it later.
    2. Others can understand what I did when they read my code.
    3. I like teaching the concepts and demonstarting them in my code.
    4. It is a win-win for everyone.
    5. I am expanding my knowledge and understanding of Python.
